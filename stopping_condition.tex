\begin{defn}
Let $\B$ be an alphabet of input digits. We say that Phase 2 is \emph{stable}, if the following conditions on the sets of possible weight coefficients which are produced by the algorithm hold: 
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item $\#\Qw{1}{k}=1 \implies \#\Qwo{k}=1$,
	\item $\Qw{1}{k}=\Qw{1}{(k+1)} \implies \Qwo{k}=\Qwo{(k+1)}$
\end{enumerate}
for all $k\in\NN$ and for all $w_0, \dots, w_{-k} \in \B$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $\B$ be an alphabet of input digits. Let Phase 2 is stable. Let $k\in\NN, k\geq 2$. We set
$$
V:=\left\{(w_{-1}, \dots, w_{-k})\in\B^k\} \colon \#\Qw{1}{k}=\#\Qw{1}{(k-1)}\right\}
$$
and
$$
E:=\left\{(w_{-1}, \dots, w_{-k})\rightarrow(w'_{-1}, \dots, w'_{-k})\in V\times V \colon (w_{-2}, \dots, w_{-k})=(w'_{-1}, \dots, w'_{-(k-1)})\right\}\,.
$$
The oriented graph $G_k=(V,E)$ is called \emph{Rauzy graph of Phase 2 (for the window of length~$k$)}.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
Let Phase 2 is stable. Let there exist $k\in\NN, k\geq 2$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item $\exists (w_0, \dots, w_{k})\in\B^{k+1}$ such that $\#\Qwo{k}>1$,
	\item there exist an infinite walk $((w_{-1}^i,\dots, w_{-k}^i))_{i\geq 0}$ in $G_k$ which starts with the edge $$(w_{0}, \dots, w_{-(k-1)})\rightarrow(w_{-1}, \dots, w_{-k})\,,$$ where $G_k$ is the Rauzy graph of Phase 2 for the window of length $k$.
\end{enumerate}
Phase 2 does not converge.
