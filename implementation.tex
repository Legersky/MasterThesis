\section{Implementation}

Our implementation of the design is based on the program attached to \cite{vu}. The chosen programming language is SageMath. It is Python-based language with numerous implemented mathematical structures. That is the main reason of our choice -- the extending window method requires to handle elements of $\Zomega$ and arithmetic operations in this set. Moreover, SageMath provides various data structures and plotting tools.  The code is simpler and more similar to pseudocode than if we implemented in pure \Cpp. Due to it, we may concern ourselves with the algorithmic part of the problem instead of difficult programming. Unfortunately, SageMath is much slower than \Cpp.


The implementation is object-oriented. It consists of five classes. Class \emph{AlgorithmForParallelAddition} contains structures for computations in $\Zomega$. The build-in classes \emph{PolynomialQuotientRing} and \emph{NumberField} are used to represent elements of $\Zomega$ as an algebraic and complex numbers. The class also links together all functions and instances of other classes which are necessary to construct an algorithm for digit set conversion from $\B$ to $\A$ by the extending window method. The input parameters are an algebraic integer $\omega$ given by its minimal polynomial $m_\omega$ and an approximate complex value, a base $\beta\in\Zomega$, an alphabet $\A\subset\Zomega$ and input alphabet $\B\subset\Zomega$. 

Phase 1 of the extending window method is implemented in class \emph{WeightCoefficientsSetSearch} and Phase 2 in \emph{WeightFunctionSearch}. Class \emph{WeightFunction} serves to save a function $q$ computed in Phase 2. The last class \emph{ExceptionParAdd} is inherited from build-in class \emph{Exception} to distinguish between errors which are raised by the algorithm  of the extending window method and other ones.

We use notation from previous chapters in descriptions of the classes. We list only the most important methods of each class, see commented source code for all of them.  

For basic use, load \verb+AlgorithmForParallelAddition.sage+, create an instance of \emph{AlgorithmForParallelAddition} and call \textbf{findWeightFunction()}.

We also provide an interface -- a shell script with given parameters is executed. If the network access is enabled and the modul \verb+gspread+ is installed (see \cite{gspread}), then results of computation are automatically saved to Google spreadsheet \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnhrHdefHfHa0WSeVs4q6XVj3epjPlPlnoekE0E1xeM/edit?usp=sharing}{ParallelAddition\_results}. The spreadsheet can be also used for loading input parameters. Both interfaces are described at the end of this section. The whole implementation is on the attached DVD or it can be downloaded from  \url{https://github.com/Legersky/ParallelAddition}.

\subsection*{User interfaces}
We provide two options of loading inputs for running the implemented extending window method. SageMath must be installed as they are executed as shell scripts.

The implementation of the extending window method is launched in a shell by typing \verb+sage ewm_inputs.sage+. The parameters of a numeration system and setting of outputs and computation is given in the head of the file \verb+ewm_inputs.sage+. See Appendix \ref{app:interfaces} for an example of such a file.


The name of the numeration system, minimal polynomial of generator $\omega$, an approximate value of $\omega$, the base $\beta$, alphabet $\A$ and input alphabet $\B$ are set in the part INPUTS. Different methods of choice for Phase 1 and 2 can be set. If there are more methods in the lists, then methods for Phase~1 are compared first. Next, each distinct result is processed with each method for Phase~2.  

The sanity check is launched according to the boolean value in the part SANITY CHECK. 

The boolean values in the part SAVING determines which formats of the outputs are saved. All outputs are saved in the folder \verb+./outputs/<name>/+. General information about the computation can be saved in the \LaTeX{} format, a computed weight function and local digit set conversion in the CSV file format.  A log of the whole computation can be saved as a text file.

Figures of the alphabet, input alphabet or weight coefficients set are saved in the PNG format in the folder \verb+./outputs/<name>/img/+ according to the boolean values in the part IMAGES. Images of individual steps of both phases of the extending window method can be also saved. For Phase 2, searching for a weight coefficient  is plotted for given input digits.  

The program prints out all inputs and then it computes a weight function $q$ by calling \fun{findWeightFunction}{}. Intermediate weight coefficients sets in each iteration of Phase 1 and the obtained weight coefficients set $\Q$ are printed out. Convergence of Phase~2 for combinations given by repetition $b\in\B$ is verified by \fun{check\_one\_letter\_inputs}{}. The processed length of window is showed during computing of Phase 2. At the end, the final length of window, elapsed time and info about saved outputs are printed. Results are also saved in the Google spreadsheet \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnhrHdefHfHa0WSeVs4q6XVj3epjPlPlnoekE0E1xeM/edit?usp=sharing}{ParallelAddition\_results} in the worksheet \verb+results+ and \verb+comparePhase1+ if there are more methods for Phase~1.

The second option is to execute the script \verb+ewm_gspreadsheet.sage+ (see Appendix \ref{app:interfaces}). Parameters are loaded from the worksheet \verb+inputs+ in the Google spreadsheet \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnhrHdefHfHa0WSeVs4q6XVj3epjPlPlnoekE0E1xeM/edit?usp=sharing}{ParallelAddition\_results}. The column A marks whether a row should be tested. The columns B--G, i.e., \emph{Name}, \emph{Alphabet}, \emph{Input alphabet}, \emph{Approximate value of ring generator omega}, \emph{Minimal polynomial omega} and \emph{Base} must be filled. If the column \emph{Input alphabet} is empty, then the input alphabet $\A+\A$ is used. Methods for Phase~1, resp. 2, are given in the cell C1, resp. C2.

Program runs in the same way as before, but results are saved only to the Google spreadsheet. Notice that column A and cells with the methods may be changed  after executing the script, but do not modify other cells or order of rows. The reason is that the program reads the methods at the beginning and it remembers position of rows to be tested, but the parameters are loaded on the fly.
