	Let $\A\subset\Zbeta$. If there is a parallel addition algorithm with the rewriting rule $x-\beta$ in the numeration system $(\beta, \A)$, then 
	$$
	\#\A \geq \max \{|m_\beta(0)|, |m_\beta(1)|\}\,.
	$$
	Moreover, if $\beta$ is such that it has a real conjugate greater than 1, then 
	$$
	\#\A \geq \max \{|m_\beta(0)|, |m_\beta(1)|+2\}\,.
	$$
