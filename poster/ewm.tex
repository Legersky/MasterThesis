\block{Extending window method}{
	The length of window $r$ and a weight function $q:(\A+\A)^{r} \rightarrow \Q \subset \Zomega$ such that $q_j=q(w_j, \dots, w_{j-(r-1)})$ are determined in two phases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The weight coefficients set $\Q$ is constructed as a finite subset of $\Zomega$.
        \item The length of window $r$ is extended until there is a unique weight coefficient from $\Q$ for all $(w_j,w_{j-1}, \dots , w_{j-(r-1)}) \in (\A+\A)^{r}$ to define the weight function $q$.
    \end{enumerate}
