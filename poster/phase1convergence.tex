\block{Success of Phase 1}{
	If the extending window method with the rewriting rule $x-\beta$ is successful for the numeration system $(\beta, \A)$, then the base $\beta$ is expanding  (absolute value of all its conjugates are greater than one).

\vspace{20pt}

	Let $\A$ contain at least one representative of each congruence class modulo $\beta$ in $\Zomega$. If $\beta$ is expanding, then Phase 1 of the extending window method is successful.
