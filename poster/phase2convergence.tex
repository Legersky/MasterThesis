\block{Failure of Phase 2}{
If number of possible weight coefficients for input digits $bb\dots b$ does not decrease for some $b\in\A+\A$ when the length of window is increased, then Phase 2 fails.

\vspace{20pt}
If there is an infinite path in the graph which is defined by non-decreasing combinations of input digits, then Phase 2 fails.
