Class \emph{WeightCoefficientsSetSearch} implements Phase 1 of the extending window method described in Section \ref{subsec:phase1} with different methods how an intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_k$ is extended to $\Q_{k+1}$. Algorithm~\ref{alg:extendWeightCoefSet} explains some of these methods. The most important method of the class is  \fun{findWeightCoefficientsSet}{} which returns a weight coefficients set $\Q$.

The constructor of the class is 
\begin{upravit}
\begin{method}{\_\_init\_\_}{ algForParallelAdd, method}
Initialize a ring generator $\omega$, base $\beta$, an alphabet $\A$ and input alphabet $\B$ by values obtained from \var{algForParallelAdd}. The parameter \var{method} characterizes how an intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_k$ is extended to $\Q_{k+1}$. If \var{None}, then method 13 from Algorithm~\ref{alg:extendWeightCoefSet} is used as default.
\end{method}

Methods implementing Phase 1 are the following:

\begin{method}{\_findCandidates}{C}
Following Algorithm \ref{alg:searchCand}, return the list of lists \var{candidates} such that each element in \var{C} is covered by any value of the appropriate list in \var{candidates}.  
\end{method}


\begin{method}{\_chooseQk\_FromCandidates}{candidates}
Take the previous intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_{k}$ as the class attribute and choose from \var{candidates} the intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_{k+1}$ by Algorithm \ref{alg:extendWeightCoefSet}.
\end{method}


\begin{method}{\_getQk}{C}
Links together methods \fun{\_findCandidates}{C} and \fun{\_chooseQk\_FromCandidates}{} to return itermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_k$.
\end{method}


\begin{method}{findWeightCoefficientsSet}{ maxIterations}
According to Algorithm \ref{alg:weightCoefSet}, return the weight coefficients set $\Q$ which is build iteratively by using \fun{\_getQk}{}. The computation is aborted if the number of iterations exceeds \var{maxIterations}. 
\end{method}
