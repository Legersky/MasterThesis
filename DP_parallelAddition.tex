%\chapter*{Introduction}

\chapter{Preliminaries}

This chapter summarizes definitions related to numeration systems and parallel addition. We recall some known results on properties of a numeration system which allows parallel addition. At the end of the chapter, we define set $\Zomega$ and determine numeration systems within the scope of this thesis.

\chapter{Design of extending window method}
\label{chap:ewm}
In this chapter, the general concept of addition and digit set conversion is recalled. We outline a so-called \emph{extending window method} which is due to M. Svobodov\'a \cite{milena}. The method consists of two phases. For a given numeration system $(\beta,\A)$, it attempts to construct a digit set conversion algorithm which is computable in parallel. We recall that $\omega$ is an algebraic integer, $\beta \in \Zomega$ is a base and $0\in\A\subset\Zomega$ is an alphabet.

\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Properties of $\Zomega$}{Properties of Z[omega]}}
We compile some properties  of the ring $\Zomega$ in this chapter. The isomorphism to $\ZZ^d$ is indicated and used for check of divisibility.  We review some results from matrix theory to introduce a norm in $\Zomega$. This norm is used in the proof of convergence of Phase~1 in Chapter~\ref{chap:convergence}. In the last section of this chapter, we show how the number of congruence classes modulo $\beta$ in $\Zomega$ is determined. That is used in the proof of a lower bound on the size of an alphabet which allows parallel addition in Section~\ref{sec:minimalAlphabet}.

\chapter{Convergence}
We discuss convergence of the extending window method designed in Chapter~\ref{chap:ewm}. We prove a necessary condition of convergence of the whole method and we show that it is also sufficient condition of convergence of Phase~1, using the tools from the previous chapter. Next, we establishes a condition which implies non-convergence of Phase~2. The condition is formulated by existence of an infinite walk in a specific directed graph. We also prove that there is the same lower bound on the size of an alphabet from $\Zbeta$ as for integer alphabets when the extending method converges.

\chapter{Different methods in the extending window method}
	\label{chap:diffChoices}
	We mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chap:ewm} that there is a lot of variability in both phases of the extending window method. Within this chapter, we propose various methods how an intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_k$ can be extended to $\Q_{k+1}$ in Phase~2 and how the set $\Qwo{k}$ can be constructed in Phase~2. The selection of methods is based on testing many experimental ones.
