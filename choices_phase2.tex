\section{Different methods in Phase 2}
\label{sec:methodsTwo}
We propose some methods which can be used in Phase~2 to construct a set $\Qwo{k}$.

The set of possible weight coefficients $\Qwo{k}$ must be a subset of the previous set of possible weight coefficients $\Qwo{(k-1)}$. It is constructed such that
$$
 w_0 + \Qw{1}{k} \subset \A + \beta \Qwo{k}\,,
$$
i.e, it is determined also by the input digit $w_0$ and the set of carries from the right $\Qw{1}{k}$. Whereas in Phase~1 the constructed set $\Q_{k+1}$ is extended from $\Q_k$, now we  reduce the set $\Qwo{(k-1)}$ to obtain $\Qwo{k}$. Set 
$$
C_x:= \left\{q_0\in\Qwo{(k-1)}\colon\, \exists \, a\in\A: x=a+\beta q_0 \right\}\,,
$$
where $x\in w_0 + \Qw{1}{k}$, and 
$$C:=\left\{C_x\colon x\in w_0 + \Qw{1}{k}\right\}\,.$$
 The goal is to find $\Qwo{k}$ such that $C_x \cap \Qwo{k} \neq \emptyset$ for all $x\in w_0 + \Qw{1}{k}$. In other words, if at least one element of each covering sets $C_x\in C$ is contained in $\Qwo{k}$, then 
$$
 w_0 + \Qw{1}{k} \subset \A + \beta \Qwo{k}\,.
$$
We follow Algorithm~\ref{alg:minimalSet} now. Choice of possible weight coefficients set starts with $\Qwo{k}':=\emptyset$. We add the elements of all $C_x\in C$ such that $\#C_x=1$ to $\Qwo{k}'$. We remove from covering set $C$ all sets $C_x\in C$ such that $\Qwo{k}' \cup C_c \neq \emptyset$. 

Next, while $C$ is nonempty, we pick an element $q$ from $\bigcup C$ according to a chosen method, we add $q$ to $\Qwo{k}'$ and we remove all sets $C_x$ which contain $q$ from $C$. Finally, the possible weight coefficient set $\Qwo{k}=\Qwo{k}'$ is found.

Before we explain different methods  to pick an element from $\bigcup C$, we define a linear order on $\Zomega$.

\begin{defn}
\label{def:lexicographical}
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and $(y_1, \dots, y_n)$ are elements of $\ZZ^n$. We say that $(x_1, \dots, x_n)\preceq (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ if 
$$
x_1<y_1 \text{ or } \left(x_1=y_1 \wedge (x_2, \dots, x_n)\preceq (y_2, \dots, y_n)\right)\,.
$$
If $x$ and $y$ are elements of $\Zomega$, then we say that $x$ is \emph{lexicographically smaller} than $y$ if
$$
\pi(x)^T \preceq \pi(y)^T\,,
$$
where $^T$ indicates transpose of column vector.
\end{defn}
Roughly speaking, elements of $\Zomega$ are first ordered according their absolute coeffient, then quadratic, etc.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:pickElement} outlines methods 9, 15, 22 and 23. All methods select a set $T$ of elements of $\bigcup C$. If there is more than one element in $T$, then the lexicographically smallest element is picked.

Method 9 computes the point of gravity $g$ of elements of $\bigcup C$ considered as complex numbers. The set $T$ are elements of  $\bigcup C$ which are closest to $g$ in absolute value. 

For remaining methods, set
$$C':=\left\{C_x \in C \colon \#C_x=\min_{C_x\in C} \#C_x \right\}\,.$$
Method 15 computes the point of gravity $g$ of already picked elements $\Qwo{k}'$ considered as complex numbers. The set $T$ are elements of  $\bigcup C'$ which are closest to $g$ in absolute value. 

Methods 22, resp. 23, builds the set $T$ to be the smallest elements of  $\bigcup C'$ in absolute value, resp.  $\beta$-norm. 

The motivation of these methods is to obtain the set $\Qwo{k}$ small and ``compact'' as it should be easier to cover them in the next iteration of Phase~2. Moreover, methods 15, 22 and 23 prefer elements from the smallest covering sets $C_x$ in the hope that the picked elements are also in the bigger covering sets.

Other implemented methods can be found in the source code.
